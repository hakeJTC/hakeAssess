Steps to create decision and metrics tables for the hake assessment
===================================================================

Create folders for
- decision table runs
- next year metrics
- second year metrics

Decision table runs
--------------------


Next year metrics
------------------
This is the metrics for a fixed catch in the next year (i.e., for the 2015 assessment, this is the 2015 catch).  In the forecast file, put in the next year's fixed catch. Make sure to enter only next year's catch so that the catch can be determined for the second year and compared to.

Second year metrics
-------------------
This is the metrics for the two year forecast. Enter catch for the next two years in the forecast file.


Catch Levels
------------
A fixed catch level is easy because you simply enter that catch level. There are a few catch levels that are determined based on specific states. These are listed below and how to determine them.

- B~curr~ = B~nextYr~ : This is the catch that results in an equal probability that the biomass in the current year is equal to the biomass in the next year.  You must iteratively modify the catch until the metric for P(BnextYr>Pcurr) is 50%.
- med(B~curr~) = med(B~nextYr~) : This is the catch that results in the median spawning biomass next year to equal the median spawning biomass for this year. Iteratively modify the catch until the median spawning biomasses are approximately equal.
